# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

When contributing to purl (such as code, bugs, documentation, etc.) you
agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin http://developercertificate.org/
and its license (see the mit.LICENSE file).  The same approach is used
by the Linux Kernel developers and several other projects.

For commits, it is best to simply add a line like this to your commit message,
with your name and email:
```
    Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <developer@example.com>
```

Please try to write a good commit message.
